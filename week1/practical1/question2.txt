-----Test Case 1-----
Test Case: Population = 0
Input: 0
Expected Output: 0
Actual Output: 0

-----Test Case 2-----
Test Case: Population = 1306000 (Adelaide population)
Input: 1306000
Expected Output: 275237.1
Actual Output: 275237.091675
Note: The discrepancy between expected and actual outputs arises from the number
of significant figures MATLAB defaults to with its float-type numbers, and my failure to account for this. Neither of these values are equal to the real-world value, it's important to note.

-----Test Case 3-----
Test Case: Population < 0
Input: -3
Expected Output: Error
Actual Output: Error
