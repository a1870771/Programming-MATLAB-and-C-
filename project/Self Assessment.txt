Conceptual coverage: I made considerable effort to ensure that all of the oulined concepts meantioned in the assessment
outline have been employed, loops, matrices, vetors, conditional execution and functions are all plainly evident in my code,
aswell as others mentioned in the practical. 20/20

Value-add: There are many parts of the code which show an extention beyond the minimum understanding required, for example, 
the implementation of ui components and figures as well as the relevant callback functions and path function of drawing on an 
axes were all concepts learnt individually through perusing the documentation rather than in the course. The code is all my
own and as such no outside contributions need be notated. 20/20

Incremental Development: In the development folder there are .m files which showcase the development of each individual
component of the code one at a time as well as the consturction of the whole project incrementally. They are 
well-commented in that their functions are described in detail at the top of each file. 20/20

Testing: In the testing.txt file there is evidence for testing of every stage of the program which had a measurable output.
15/20

Comments and style: Consistent and relevant comments are evident throughout the script, and stylistic convention is adhered
to in terms of indenting and variable names. 20/20
