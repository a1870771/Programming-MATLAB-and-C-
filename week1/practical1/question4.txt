-----Test Case 1-----
Test Case: Population = 1306000 (Adelaide)
Input: 1306000
Expected Output: 1.44 million.
Actual Output: 14372249.620979
Note: Once again MATLAB is throwing many many significant figures at me, but happily if it were whittled down to 3 S.F then 1.44 million would be correct.

-----Test Case 2-----
Test Case: Population = 1
Input: 1
Expected Output: 11
Actual Output: 11.004785
Note: This is an interesting one, because even though the perPersonCost = $16, since just under 70% of people drive to work the total average cost is $11, even when there's only one person to account for. 

-----Test Case 3-----
Test Case: Population < 0
Input: -50
Expected Output: Negative Error
Actual Output: Negative Error

----Test CAse 4-----
Test Case: Population not an integer
Input: 1.306
Expected Output: Integer Error
Actual Output: Integer Error
