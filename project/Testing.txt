                            ====================        TESTING         ====================

Each input is represented by a 4*4 subsection of the playing grid, where a 1 is equivalent to a living cell and a 0 is
equivalent to a dead cell. Expected outputs were recorded manually from playthegameoflife.com, and actual output was 
recorded manually from the currentGrid variable in my MATLAB script. This demonstrates that the gui-free v1 file works,
and the fact that the expected output is reflected also in the gui grid mean the ensuing versions work aswell.
